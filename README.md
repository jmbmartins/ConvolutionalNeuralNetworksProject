Machine Learning Practical Project III - Convolutional Neural Networks
======================================================================

This repository contains the solution to Practical Project III on Convolutional Neural Networks for the Machine Learning course. The project is based on the statement provided in the "enunciado_p3_ml_23_24.pdf" file.

Folder Structure
----------------

-   **AR/**: Contains the "AR.zip" dataset used in the project.
-   **AR_out/**: Output folder for the dataset.
-   **Pratical_Project_III.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the resolution of the project statement.
-   **Rel_P03.pdf**: Report detailing the work done, methodology, results, and conclusions.
-   **enunciado_p3_ml_23_24.pdf**: Original practical project statement.
-   **scr_deep_learning_CNN_keras.py**: Helper script adapted for the project.

Project Overview
----------------

In this project, the goal was to adapt the provided script to learn from large datasets, use different network architectures, and create models for predicting ID, facial expression, gender, and glasses based on the "AR.zip" dataset.

Instructions
------------

1.  Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).
2.  Run the "Pratical_Project_III.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook to see the solution and results.
3.  Refer to the "Rel_P03.pdf" report for a detailed explanation of the work done.
